## Title page
An 8-bit style presentation slide with the title "Talk data to me?". Two 8-bit characters, one with black hair and a red shirt on the left, and another with brown hair and a purple shirt on the right, stand on either side of a dark blue and light blue 8-bit wave design. The wave swaps direction between the two in a simple animation, as their mouths open and close. Below the wave, the text reads "Supporting English Language Learners in Statistics and Data Science" followed by a list of names under "Liza Bolton, Ping Huang, Christy Sun, Jingdi Sun with collaborators at the University of Toronto: Nathalie Moon, Samantha-Jo Caetano, J. Sparks, Quin Xie".
