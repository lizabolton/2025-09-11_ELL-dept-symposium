Goal: *Explore how support for ELL students can be integrated at various scales — from small modifications to teaching practices to large changes in assessment and design. Opportunities will be illustrated across junior and senior undergraduate statistics and data science courses in Canada, Aotearoa New Zealand and China.*

Outputs: ICOTS presentation in Brisbane next year + peer reviewed conference paper (due later this year); NZSA; + RA led work

So for now, this in an early invitation to discuss challenges and opportunities you have faced and would like to share or seek support in.

Bonjour, kia ora, 你好 (안녕, こんにちは)

<br>
English is the first language I learned, and it is the one I am most fluent in. I have never had my personal success, safety or access to resources rely on my abilities in another language. Many of you have first-hand experience with learning English as an additional language, that I don't.

<br>
Language is not 'just' a skill — it is part of culture, identity and how we know others and make ourselves known in turn.

# Some other ideas

## 🤔 Think 👯 Pair 🗣️ Share

In this classroom strategy, you present students with a task or question and then they work through three phases: thinking, pairing and finally sharing. 

The sharing can be out loud in the class, but I really like to pair the speaking ‘pairing’ phase with an anonymous written ‘sharing’ phase using an app like Anna’s Stats App to reduce embarrassment.

## Supporting spoken instructions with written/visual prompts

- This is an example of one (of the many!) reasons doing peer observations of teaching is helpful. If I found I was missing or not fully hearing instructions during an activity, it seems reasonable to expect students will too. 

- Not only does this support ELL students, but it can also support students with auditory processing issues or executive function/focus challenges. *Multi-support win!* 🏅 

- ⏎🔥 Backfire: teaching at SWU, this meant students just put the questions in an LLM chatbot and submitted the answer from DeepSeek 😭.

## Creating glossaries/cheat sheets as an assessment task

- In recent years, it has been more common to hear student feedback at class rep meetings about wanting teacher provided glossaries and summary sheets.
- Perhaps many of our students haven't learned how to learn.
- Incentivising learning practices that also support language acquisition and

## Title page {visibility="uncounted"}
An 8-bit style presentation slide with the title "Talk data to me?". Two 8-bit characters, one with black hair and a red shirt on the left, and another with brown hair and a purple shirt on the right, stand on either side of a dark blue and light blue 8-bit wave design. The wave swaps direction between the two in a simple animation, as their mouths open and close. Below the wave, the text reads "Supporting English Language Learners in Statistics and Data Science" followed by a list of names under "Liza Bolton, Ping Huang, Christy Sun, Jingdi Sun with collaborators at the University of Toronto: Nathalie Moon, Samantha-Jo Caetano, J. Sparks, Quin Xie".
